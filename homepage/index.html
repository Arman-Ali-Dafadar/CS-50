            <h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>
            <p style="padding-top: 1rem;">Here is a brief Why I a 18 year old boy loves the media or art to be exact created by thousands of artists known as Anime.</p>
            <h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Why I love this piece of content known as anime???</h2>
            <p style="padding-top: 1rem;">Anime has always been an integral part of my life since childhood whether it being Beyblade, Pokemon or Idaten Jump during my childhood years or animes like Death note, Monster or Tokyo Revengers in my teen years. Anime like Naruto has helped me understand the importance of human relationships with your friends, between a child and his parents, between a student and a mentor, between two loved ones. Anime like Grave of the Fireflies tells us about a brother and sister who have lost their parents in a war and are trying to survive on their own with a not so happy ending unlike most pieces of media. Anime like Attack on Titan tells us a story of a person who went against the world for the freedom of his friends but at the end his friends choose the world instead of him. And many more stories which are phenomenal and absolute Masterpieces like Monster.</p>

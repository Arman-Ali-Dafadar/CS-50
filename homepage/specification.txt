The Bootstrap feature i choose is the btn class which helped me easily style my buttons and the <a> tags.

The script.js file consist of multiple functions used to calculate the no. of correct answers provided by the user and decides their appropriate rank and prints it on the Finalpage. I have used the localStorage method to store the correct value of result accross multiple pages.

# CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard)

This repository contains my completed coursework and problem sets from **Harvard University’s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science**.

I started CS50 in **September 2025** and completed all required problem sets and exercises as part of the official CS50 collaboration environment. After finishing the course, I consolidated my work into this repository for **portfolio, learning reference, and long-term tracking**.

## About the Commit History

**Important note on commits**

The original development and incremental commits were made inside the CS50 collaboration workspace.  
After completing the course, I downloaded all of my work and committed it here as a single consolidated repository.

Because of this:
- The commit history **does not reflect the original timeline**
- The code itself represents my **genuine work and learning** during the course

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by weeks / topics covered in CS50, including concepts such as:

- C programming fundamentals  
- Variables, loops, and conditionals  
- Arrays, algorithms, and problem solving  
- Memory management and pointers  
- Basic data structures  
- Introduction to computer science thinking  

Each folder contains the corresponding problem sets and exercises for that topic.

## What I Learned from CS50

- Strong foundations in **computer science fundamentals**
- Writing efficient and readable C programs
- Breaking down problems into logical steps
- Understanding how memory works at a low level
- Developing disciplined problem-solving habits

CS50 played a major role in shaping how I approach programming and learning new technologies.
